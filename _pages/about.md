About me
======
My name is Anwei and I'm a second-generation Chinese American from San Francisco. My family is from Hong Kong and Guangdong, China, and I was educated in the U.S. and Taiwan. I can fluently speak Mandarin, Cantonese, Taishanese, English and Japanese. I also have working knowledge of Taiwanese Hokkien, Korean and Spanish. Because of my background, I have developed a passion for learning about and spreading knowledge regarding different cultures and languages to others. I also love getting to know new people who come from their own diverse backgrounds, and all of these factors have led me to pursue a graduate degree and conduct my current research in the field of Chinese Linguistics and Second Language Acquisition.
